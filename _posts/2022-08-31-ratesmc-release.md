The new version of RatesMC has some significant improvements, including:

* **Correlations between parameters**  
  This was a hidden feature in the past. Now it's been reworked to be more user friendly
* **AME mass tables**  
  Now you don't need to enter the nuclear masses, RatesMC will do it for you!
* **Ground-state spins**  
  Similarly, the Nubase can be used to assign ground-state spins to the reacting nuclei
* **Factor Uncertainties**  
  Factor uncertainties used to be something you'd have to calculate by hand. Now RatesMC can do it for you! See the [documentation](https://github.com/rlongland/RatesMC#new-features) for details
