excerpt: "Our paper on the structure of <sup>21</sup>Ne and its influence on the <sup>17</sup>O+alpha reaction rates in rotating massive stars has been published!"
---

In collaboration with the York nuclear astrophysics group, we measured the structure of <sup>21</sup>Ne for states around the $\alpha$-particle threshold. These states strongly influence the $^{17}$O$+ \alpha$ reaction rates.

The exquisite resolution of the TUNL split-pole spectrograph allowed us to resolve many states in $^{21}$Ne, allowing us to accurately calculate the rate.
