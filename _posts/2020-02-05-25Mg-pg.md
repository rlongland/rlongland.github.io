Our research group and collaborators at the University of Edinburgh, UK, have recently had their paper on constraining the $^{25}$Al$+$p reaction rate in classical nova explosions. By studying the $^{25}$Mg(d,p)$^{26}$Mg, excited states in the mirror nucleus were populated and neutron spectroscopic factors were extracted. We measured the spectroscopic factor of the key 0+ resonance and set a stringent upper limit on the 1+ resonance. The result of these findings is a dramatic decrease of the reaction rate below 200 MK.
