excerpt: "Our papers on the direct measurement of <sup>7</sup>Be(&alpha;,&gamma;)<sup>11</sup>C at the DRAGON recoil separator have been published!"
---

We joined a collaboration led by Thanassis Psaltis and Alan Chen to measure the $^7$Be($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{11}$C cross section at the DRAGON (Detector of Recoils and Gammas of Nuclear Reactions) recoil separator located at TRIUMF, Canada. Two resonances at 1155 keV and 1110 keV were measured for the first time. Our group calculated the reaction rate resulting from this measurement, and found the new reaction rate uncertainty to be just 10%! Our two papers in Phys. Rev. Lett. and Phys. Rev. C were recently published.
