We were recently joined by new postdoctoral researcher, Thanassis Psaltis! Thanassis is an expert in both experimental and computational nuclear astrophysics, and brings those skills to our group. We look forward to working with him for the next several years!

We also have a new crop of graduate students. Briana Strickland and Victor Beaty joined NC State in 2021, and recently joined our group as Research Assistants. We're excited for the new chapter in our research program that they represent!
