excerpt: "Our paper on our highly-detailed study of <sup>24</sup>Mg and its influence on the sodium-oxygen anti-correlation in globular clusters has been published!"

Led by Dr. Caleb Marshall, we performed a high-resolution, highly detailed study of excited states in <sup>24</sup>Mg using the <nobr>$^{23}$Na($^3$He,d)$^{24}$Mg</nobr> proton transfer reaction. This was the first application of our recently-developed Bayesian DWBA analysis methods to our own data, which included coupling of elastic scattering and transfer data with common systematic effects taken into account. 

The results of this study provide the most statistically-meaningful proton spectroscopic factor information on <sup>24</sup>Mg to date. We investigated the impact of our findings on the nucleosynthesis of $^{24}$Mg in Asymptotic Giant Branch stars.
