A thorough evaluation of the $\sf ^{39}$K(p,$\gamma$)$\sf ^{40}$Ca reaction rate was performed to better understand the nucleosynthesis of potassium in globular clusters. We found that significant discrepencies in previous measurements lead to large reaction rate uncertainties, and provided recommendations for future study to resolve those issues.
