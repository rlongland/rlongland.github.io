Caitlin started a new beam tuning philosophy in the tandem lab by
developing a feedback-assisted tuning system. The system is built on
EPICS and was developed to help us transport beam between the
high-energy end of the tandem accelerator and the entrance to the
high-resolution 90-90 beamline where multiple optical elements make
tuning a challenge.  

*Fun fact: Caitlin has visited 19 states*
