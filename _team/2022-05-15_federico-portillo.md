Federico is interested in low energy nuclear reactions and their
applications to astrophysics. Over the last few months, he's become
the group's silicon detector and low-noise measurement expert. 
          
*Fun fact: Federico is a former semi-pro futsal goalkeeper (<a

is similar to, but not the same as indoor soccer).*
