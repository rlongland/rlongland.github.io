Will was drawn to the connection between astrophysics and experimental
nuclear physics early on in his graduate career. He has been working
on the development of our group's new data acquisition (DAQ) system
that is designed to be used alongside our digitizer, a replacement for
our old detector electronics. Additionally, he has worked on the
development of our new graphical user interface (GUI), EngeSpec, and
has tested both the DAQ and the GUI with
	    gamma-ray signals from NaI detectors.  

*Fun Fact: Loves watching classic films and enjoys game development.*
