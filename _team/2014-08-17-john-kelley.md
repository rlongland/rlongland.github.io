John's familiarity with various electronics configurations and
	    data-acquisition systems contributes to experimental
	    activities and data analysis procedures in the group. His past
	    experience with rare isotope beams and involvement in
	    evaluating the nuclear structure of light nuclei, in
	    association with the US Nuclear Data Program, creates a strong
	    interest in the nuclear astrophysical studies that are carried
	    out at TUNL.  
        
*Fun fact: John is the parent of twin boys.*
