Briana started working with the group in Summer 2020 through the TUNL
REU program and continued with the group in graduate school. During
her REU, she worked on reconstructing cross sections in the Enge Focal
Plane which resulted in a script that extracts cross sections in finer
detail. She is currently working on implementing this method into our
EngeSpec software for experimental use. She is also working on
upgrades to the target chamber.

*Fun Fact: Briana likes to play video games and crochet.*
