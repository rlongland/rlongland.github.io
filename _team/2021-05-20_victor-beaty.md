Victorâ€™s introduction to experimental nuclear physics started in the
Summer of 2019 at UNCW, with Dr. Timothy Daniels where he identified
an unknown isotope within an irradiated gas cell spectra. Through this
experience the following fall they were introduced to Dr. Longland's
group as it was an intersection between their previous interest in
astrophysics and their new interests in experimental nuclear physics.
While an undergrad his work with Dr. Longland included EngeSpec
updates: such as coding the log-log toggle with color bar, and a
Gaussian fitting protocol. Other such projects in-tailed an analysis
of the Narrow Resonance Rate Approximation. Victor counties to pursue
their interests in the field in grad school. Projects he has worked on
thus far entail: more EngeSpec upgrades, designing an end-piece for
the Target Implantation Device at TUNL, designing a gas mount for the
same device, and creating a virtual CAD drawing for the sliding seal
that goes on the target chamber.

*Fun Fact: Victor enjoys cooking and baking regularly. Banana bread is his specialty.*
