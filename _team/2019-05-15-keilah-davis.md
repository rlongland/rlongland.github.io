Keilah is working on novel statistical
	      techniques to analyze some data that she took
	      at TUNL over the summer (2017). Her results
	      will impact our understanding of sodium
	      production in Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)
	      stars.  

*Fun fact: Keilah sings in the a cappella group <a
