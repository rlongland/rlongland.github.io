Jay was a junior in physics when he joined our group. He is developing
a complex set of commissioning procedures for our digital data
acquisition hardware. So far, his work has involved working with the
MIDAS data acquisition software and developing custom c++ and R code
for analyzing simulated detector signals. This will be coupled with
Daniel's work in the near future.  

*Fun fact: Jay enjoys gold prospecting as a hobby.*
