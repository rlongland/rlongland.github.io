Kaixin has gained some experience on experiment and data analysis work regarding particle transfer reactions. He has been updating the stepper motor system at Enge using EPICS and perfoming MCMC and DWBA analysis on $^{23}$Na($^3$He,d) spectroscopy. He has recently started his thesis project on $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy of $^{24}$Mg.


*Fun fact: Kaixin name means 'happy' in Chinese. Happy Song!*
