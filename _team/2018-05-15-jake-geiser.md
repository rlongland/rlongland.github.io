Jake is behind the Tandem laboratory's new 3D model that is now in use
lab-wide for presentations and design planning. But aside from that,
his research project involved developing techniques for splitting
single cross section measurements into multiple ray-traced cross
sections in software. This technique will allow us to more precisely
constrain the optical model potentials
used to analyze our data.  
        
*Fun fact: Jake has been to the largest blowhole in the world (Kiama, AU).*
